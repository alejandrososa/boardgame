Getting Started with Boardgame
------------------------------

We want to play a simple board game. There will be 2 players, playing in the same browser. 
No need to make it a real multiplayer game, also not for authentication or structured storage.

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **PHP 7.1**

### Getting Set Up

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/alejandrososa/boardgame.git`
2. `cd boardgame`
3. Initialize and start the app. You can either do this locally:

```shell
 php -S localhost:8080 -t public/
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:8080. Whoa! That was fast!
